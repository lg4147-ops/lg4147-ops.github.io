This is Liyan Gong. He is widely (and incorrectly) regarded as the finest mathematician at Courant,
He spend most of his time proving things that were already known. When not attempting to solve unsolved problems, he perfects his *cooking skills* arguably with more success than in mathematics and occasionally dominates the *Hearthstone ladder*.


**Third City of My Life - Starting at NYC**

I’ve just started my journey at New York University — my first time living and studying abroad all on my own. Everything here feels fresh and exciting! I’m really enjoying the academic atmospheren at courant; it makes me feel like I’m  on the right path in my academic journey. I’ve been working hard toward my goals. For now, the goal is to obtain a phd admission and it’s nice to feel that the effort is leading me somewhere meaningful.


**Second City of My Life - Study and Live in Guangzhou**

Only after moving to New York did I fully realize just how amazing the food in Guangzhou actually is. I genuinely regret not eating even more while I had the chance.

Anyway—back to the main story. I studied mathematics for four years at the School of Mathematics at Sun Yat-sen University. Looking back now, I’m surprised by how much math we actually learned. That experience really gave me a solid foundation, and I’m grateful for my undergraduate advisor, Prof. Chai Lihui, who guided me throughout those years.

During that time, I also went to summer schools, some seminars and slowly figured out that I was truly drawn to applied mathematics. So, in the end, I came to the Courant Institute at NYU to chase that interest—and, in a sense, to chase a dream of my own.

**First City of My Life - Memories in Wuhu**

This is the place where I was born. I spent my entire childhood and teenage years in Wuhu — it’s my hometown, a small city tucked between mountains and rivers. I grew up in Wuhu and spent all my school years there — from elementary all the way through high school. One day I might even retire there; the idea sounds pretty nice. By around 9 p.m., the streets are already empty, as if the whole city collectively decided to go to bed early. People there have a wonderfully laid-back, almost Buddhist level of chill.
