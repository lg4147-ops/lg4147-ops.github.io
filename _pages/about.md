Starting at NYC
======
I’ve just started my journey at New York University — my first time living and studying abroad all on my own. Everything here feels fresh and exciting! I’m really enjoying the academic atmospheren at courant; it makes me feel like I’m  on the right path in my academic journey. I’ve been working hard toward my goals. For now, the goal is to obtain a phd admission and it’s nice to feel that the effort is leading me somewhere meaningful.
