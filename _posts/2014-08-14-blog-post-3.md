During my time at the Courant Institute, I made an amusing—and honestly, inspiring—observation: mathematicians here live incredibly long lives. Not just long, but legendary long. Actually, I got this idea from Prof. Tabak. He always says that mathematicians live long lives.

Take Ting Luo, who lived to be 100 years old, or Peter Lax, who reached 99. These are not just giants of mathematics; they’re also giants in longevity. Unfortunately, I wasn’t in the U.S. early enough to meet these legends in person, which remains one of my academic regrets. But still, the thought of being just a few degrees of separation away from them already feels quite special.

After some discussions with friends (and some late-night overthinking on my own), I came up with a few playful hypotheses about this Courant “longevity phenomenon.”

1. A Rich Inner World (and a Great Sense of Humor)
   ======

One common trait I’ve noticed among the professors here is simply how kind, respectful, and genuinely joyful they are. They love discussing ideas, they joke around effortlessly, and they always seem intellectually and spiritually fulfilled.

If inner peace and daily happiness contribute to long life, then honestly, many Courant professors are already immortal.

I admire this deeply—and, secretly, I hope that one day I can achieve even a small part of that same balance between rigorous thinking and joyful living.

2. A Completely Unscientific Walking Theory (Please Don’t Quote Me)
   ======

Here’s a far less rigorous theory—but it makes me laugh, so I’ll share it anyway.

Unlike many universities where professors drive everywhere and then sit for hours in their offices, New York City makes driving inconvenient. Painfully inconvenient. So people walk. A lot. Even mathematicians.

Walking to campus, walking to get groceries, walking to the subway, walking because traffic is terrible—walking is unavoidable. And maybe, just maybe, this constant movement keeps everyone a bit healthier.

For example, after just a few weeks of walking to Warren Weaver Hall every day, my calves already started protesting. So perhaps this is Courant’s secret training program for future longevity.

Looking Ahead: A Courant Oral History Project?
======

All of this has made me curious about the institute’s history, the personalities who shaped it, and the stories that aren’t written in textbooks. I’ve even been considering doing a small “Courant history project”—maybe interviews, maybe essays, maybe both.

It sounds fun, meaningful, and like a way to connect with this place beyond just homework sets and exam stress.
