On Guessing a Mathematician’s Research Field from Their Style
======

I’m not sure whether this method is universal—or whether it only works at Courant—but sometimes I feel you can guess a mathematician’s research area just by looking at their clothes and overall vibe.

For example, if someone’s outfit is a little flashy or stylish, my instinct is: probably probability theory. Maybe it’s because probability often gets associated with finance, trading floors, and even casinos. The whole field feels closer to the world of business than other branches of math, so perhaps people working in probability naturally absorb a bit of that atmosphere.

On the other hand, if someone dresses in a very modest, simple, almost minimalist way, I tend to think: likely geometry. Think of Mikhail Gromov—purely as a reference point, with no disrespect intended. There’s something about geometers that gives off a quiet, understated aesthetic, as if their minds are occupied with shapes, structures, and deep abstractions rather than fashion.

Of course, this is all just playful speculation. But maybe there is something to it—at least here at Courant.
