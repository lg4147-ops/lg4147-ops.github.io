I worked under the supervision of Director Peng Qi at the Chongqing Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, on a text-to-video generation project. Dr. Zhuang provided additional guidance throughout the process. Together with my senior collaborator Yang xuezheng, we carried the project forward over a period of six months, holding regular weekly meetings to discuss progress, refine our methodology, and coordinate implementation.
